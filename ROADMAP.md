# Drasi Roadmap

We welcome feedback on Drasi's plannedfeatures and improvements. This README is used to track important items on the roadmap and is managed by the Drasi maintainers.
 
The areas we are focusing on include:

* Improve the Solution Developer experience by making it easier to learn and adopt Drasi and provide tools that make it easier to write, test, and debug Continuous Queries.
* Make it easy to extend Drasi with new Sources and Reactions.
* Implement a flexible security model for Drasi that protects data flowing through the system and integrates with existing security management systems.
* Establish standard test infrastructure and baseline performance metrics so we can measure the impact of future changes in the rapidly evolving codebase.
* Improve platform resilience with high availability and disaster recovery functionality.
* Increase operational readiness through observability and management functionality.
